## Docker

You can use official `realmankwon/upvu:latest` image to run Vision locally, deploy it to staging or even production environment. The simplest way is to run it with following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 realmankwon/upvu:latest
```

Configure the instance using following environment variables:

- `USE_PRIVATE`

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -e USE_PRIVATE=1 realmankwon/upvu:latest
```

### Swarm

You can easily deploy a set of vision instances to your production environment, using example `docker-compose.yml` file. Docker Swarm will automatically keep it alive and load balance incoming traffic between the containers:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.production.yml vision
```
